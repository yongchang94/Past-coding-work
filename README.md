# Past coding work

Please see the files here for examples of my past work using both R and Python. 

Three noteworthy projects are the 'Demographic_Analysis_Assignment_2', 'Replication_Project', and 'MPhil Sociology and Demography-Thesis'. I have attached the R/markdown script and the corresponding PDF/html files. 

I would direct you to the the Demographic Analysis html file first (please see the emailed copy if viewing issues arise), followed by the Replication. The Thesis is the longest of all. They contain examples of code to build and clean large datasets, before analysing and drawing insights from them.

I have also included class work on social network analysis for added reference. These are the 'Chin_OSN20' jupyter notebook files. They are just samples of my weekly homework, warts and all, but I thought it would be good to have on record as well.

Please reach out if there's anything else.
