# Past coding work

Please see the files here for examples of my past work using both R and Python. They contain examples of code to build and clean large datasets, before analysing and drawing insights from them. All data wrangling and analysis was done by myself.

Four noteworthy projects are the 'Demographic_Analysis_Assignment_2', 'OSN Summative', 'Replication_Project', and 'MPhil Sociology and Demography-Thesis'. I have attached the R/markdown script and the corresponding PDF/html files.

- The Demographic Analysis submission required building a dataset to investigate life expectancy, fertility rates, and population change.
- The OSN (Online Social Network) project re-analyses a study dealing with information proliferation in a network analysis framework.
- The Replication Project replicated and extended multiple studies' regression models analysing child development.
- And the Thesis built a dataset to describe and analyse parental involvement in childcare and its effects.

I would direct you to the Demographic Analysis html file first (please see the emailed copy if viewing issues arise), followed by the OSN Summative, and then the Replication. The Thesis is the longest of all.

I have also included class work on social network analysis for added reference. These are the 'Chin_OSN20' jupyter notebook files. These are just samples of weekly assignment submissions, but I thought it would be good to have on record as well.

Please reach out if there's anything else.
