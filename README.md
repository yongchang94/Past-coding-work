# Past coding work

Please see the files here for examples of past work in both R and Python. 

Three noteworthy projects are the 'Demographic_Analysis_Assignment_2', 'Replication_Project', and 'MPhil Sociology and Demography-Thesis'. The Thesis is the biggest of the three. I have attached the R/markdown script and the corresponding PDF/html files. These contain examples of working with and cleaning large datasets, before drawing insights from them.

I have also included class work on social network analysis for added reference. These are the 'Chin_OSN20' jupyter notebook files. These are just samples of my weekly homework, mistakes and all, but I thought it would be good to have on record as well.

Please reach out if there's anything else.
