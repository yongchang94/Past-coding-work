# Past coding work

Please see the files here for examples of past work in both R and Python. 

Three noteworthy projects are the 'Demographic_Analysis_Assignment_2', 'Replication_Project', and 'MPhil Sociology and Demography-Thesis'. I have attached the R/markdown script and the corresponding PDF/html files. These contain examples of working with and cleaning large datasets, and drawing insights from them.

I have also included my submission for my 'Replication Project' as well as class work on social network analysis for your added reference. The social network analysis is samples of my weekly homework, mistakes and all, but I thought it would be good to have on record as well.

Please reach out if there's anything else.
