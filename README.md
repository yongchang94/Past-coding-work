# Past-coding-work

Please see the files here for examples of past work in both R and Python. 

Of particular interest is my submission for 'Demographic Analysis' and my 'Thesis'. The Thesis is very long while the Demographic Analysis assignment is much easier to read. I have attached the R/markdown script and the html/PDF as well. These two contain examples of working with and cleaning large datasets, and drawing insights from them.

I have also included my submission for my 'Replication Project' as well as class work on social network analysis for your added reference. The social network analysis is weekly homework, mistakes and all, but I thought it would be good to have on record as well.
